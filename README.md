Software Design and Implementation 

The assignment is a group coursework (with some individual tasks, see Section 1 and 2). Given the problem scenario in Section 2, the group is required to produce a collective report of the designed and implemented software application.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a hot research/innovation topic and aims to replicate some human capabilities in machines. AI is being applied in many research/innovations areas including Computer Vision. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are being used for performing online/offline object classification. CNNs, like other types of Neural Networks and Machine Learning algorithms, MUST be trained on a dataset. Datasets are a collection of data, with the same characteristics as the data that will be used for classification, that needs to be annotated (i.e. identify the region of interest) using a labelling tool.

For this assignment, the group was expected to implement a labelling application (software) using C++ for annotating Datasets for being used by CNNs. The group was not expected to implement or use a CNN for this assignment; the implemented application just needs to provide the appropriate labelling functionality.
